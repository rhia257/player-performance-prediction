# üéÆ Player Performance Prediction Model  

## Overview  
This project builds a **Random Forest Regression** model in Python to predict how long players take to complete a video game level.  
The model uses gameplay features such as **ammo usage** and **level difficulty** to estimate **completion time**.  

## Business Application  
- **Player Engagement:** Turn predictions into real-time challenges (e.g., ‚ÄúOur model predicts you‚Äôll finish in 98s ‚Äî can you beat it?‚Äù).  
- **Personalized Guidance:** Help players choose levels based on estimated completion time.  
- **Game Design Insights:** Provide developers with feedback on whether levels are too easy, too hard, or unbalanced.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor, train_test_split, r2_score)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

## Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Removed the target column (`completion_time`) from the feature set.  
   - Split dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.  

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Used `RandomForestRegressor` with a fixed random state for reproducibility.  
   - Trained on the training dataset and generated predictions on the test set.  

3. **Evaluation:**  
   - Compared predictions with actual values using **R¬≤ score**.  
   - Created a DataFrame to visualize actual vs predicted times.  

## Recommendations for Improvement  
- Improve dataset quality and ensure it‚Äôs fully validated.  
- Add more features (e.g., player history, weapon types).  
- Test alternative regression models and tune hyperparameters.  
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
